# Final_Project

This repository contains four machine learning projects, focusing on different tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. Each project addresses real-world problems and demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.

## Project 1: Eye Disease Classification

### Task:
Eye disease classification is essential for assisting ophthalmologists in diagnosing various eye conditions based on medical imaging data. The primary goal of this project is to build a model that classifies medical images into one of the following categories:
- Cataract
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Glaucoma
- Normal (No disease)

### Key Aspects:
- Dataset consists of medical images.
- Machine learning and computer vision techniques are utilized.
- Four-class classification problem.

## Project 2: Loan Status Prediction (Classification Model)

### Task:
This project aims to predict the loan status (approved or rejected) based on various applicant and property-related factors. Using a dataset of loan applicants, the goal is to determine whether an applicant's loan should be approved or not.

### Key Aspects:
- Factors considered: Applicant Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, Co-applicant Income, etc.
- Classification models used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.

## Project 3: Sales Forecasting (Regression Model)

### Task:
In this project, the objective is to forecast department-wide sales for 45 retail stores based on historical data. The dataset includes markdown events that occur around major holidays such as the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

### Key Aspects:
- Dataset includes information about stores, markdown events, and macroeconomic factors.
- Regression techniques used to predict future sales.

## Project 4: Credit Card Data - Customer Segmentation (Clustering Model)

### Task:
This project involves developing a customer segmentation model using a credit card dataset with information about customer behavior. The goal is to create clusters of customers for targeted marketing strategies.

### Key Aspects:
- Dataset contains 8950 active credit card holders' data over the last 6 months.
- Variables include balance, purchases, credit limit, payments, and other behavioral factors.
- Clustering techniques used to segment customers.
- Provides insights for marketing strategies based on customer segmentation.
